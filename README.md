# FAIR-emission-climate-model

- Investigating effect of different emissions on global temperature change
- Using FAIR climate model for species' forcing analysis
- By finding the year when maximum forcing occured, and coefficient of variation measurements, we can sort out species that aren't important to forcing model
- Eliminating those species can help enhance the model's runspeed, also preventing overfitting
